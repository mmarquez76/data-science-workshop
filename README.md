# PantherHacks 2020 - Python for Data Science

Learn the basics of using Jupyter Notebooks, as well as essential Python data tools like pandas, numpy, and matplotlib!

This workshop is **cross-platform**, so all operating systems should follow the same instructions (except for Linux, but if you use Linux, you probably already know how to do this.)
